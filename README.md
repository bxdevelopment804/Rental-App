  Rental App
</h1>

1.  **What Does This Rental App Do?**

    Developed for a local business, this allows potential tenants to apply online for one of their properties in lieu of the previously used paper applications.

2.  **Design Intent**

    Create a landing page for a local business. Site provides the Client email notification of all tenant applications, without the need for a SMTP server.

    MaterialUI, Formik, and Yup were used for components and structure, form state, and form validation respectively. Each application page has it's own Formik setup and Yup validation schema. ReactNumberFormat was used to mask number fields, while Context was used to streamline page status amongst components.
